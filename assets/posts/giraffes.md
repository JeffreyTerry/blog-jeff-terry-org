A few weeks ago, while driving with a friend, I heard him shout at a driver for cutting us off at a stop sign. After initially empathizing with his frustration, I thought to myself, “It’s not a big deal, is it? We’re alive, they’re alive. We’re both probably unhappy that this happened, and I bet she'll try to avoid cutting people off in the future.” The event was about to recede from my mind, but my friend was adamant. So adamant that he spent the rest of the car ride mulling over the person's actions. Why would she do that? I can’t believe she would do that. What an a**! Why are people like that allowed to drive? She should be *euthanized*.

By the time we were out of the car, my friend was having a positively bad day. I, on the other hand, was thinking about giraffes. Specifically, what their ancestors must have looked like, how long their nerve cells must be, what a miracle it was that I could think about such things in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Indeed, I was having a positively fantastic day. But why was my day so much better than my friend’s? Was it because I hadn’t been cut off at a stop sign? Nope. Was it because I’m just a better person? Nope. Was it because I was simply being more optimistic? Maybe. But I think it was something deeper.

I think that what I recognized in that split second after being cut off at the stop sign, and what my friend failed to recognize, was that there are more interesting things to think about than a person's reasons for cutting me off. Perhaps she cut me off intentionally; perhaps she just didn’t see me; perhaps she was pregnant and the baby was coming out right there at that intersection. Whatever his reasons were for cutting me off, I think it’s safe to say my time was better spent pondering the evolutionary history of the giraffe.

So why was I having a better day than my friend? To use a classic idiom, I decided to not sweat the small stuff. Instead, I spent my time thinking about bigger things, like giraffes, and was all the happier for it.

Until next time,
