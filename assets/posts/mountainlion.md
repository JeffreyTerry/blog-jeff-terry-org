Yeah I don't even know what that means. What is time, even? I mean, obviously everything you're watching right now has already happened, so it can never literally happen next, can it? I guess it depends on what you think "next" means in this context.

I'll give you seven days to think about this. After that time, we will [contact you](/imgs/miscellaneous/hello.jpg). We'll want your very-well-thought-out opinions. Thanks!
