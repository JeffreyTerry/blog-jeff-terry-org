My first few blogs are going to be about OSX versions. This is because I want content. And because people love cats. OS X fits my needs like a glove fits a hand. It provides content, and that content is cats. Nice.

This post is about OS X Tiger. I didn't even own a Mac when Tiger came out, so I'm not even sure it's a real OS version. It's definitely a cat though, so I'm pretty much 100% sure it was also an OS X version.

PEACE,
