Big S/O to Poet. It made creating this blog slightly easier. Very slightly. I'd say just slightly enough.

I've never seen a Yosemite cat before. Conspiracy? Only you can be the judge, but let me just tell you: it's a conspiracy. And they're all in on it. All of them. Especially The Man. He's very involved.

I can't tell you why they (see: The Man) chose Yosemite, but it's most likely diabolical.

L8TER,
