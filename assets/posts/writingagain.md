I haven’t voluntarily written since June. Now, when I write, I feel myself struggling. I don’t struggle to write sentences. No, I can write those just find. My verbs take their natural places next to my nouns, and my nouns next to my adjectives. I struggle, though, to tie my sentences together. I struggle to construct those arcs of narrative described so eloquently by Steven Pinker in his The Sense of Style and present, I believe, in all compelling writing.

I haven’t simply been struggling to construct narrative when I write. I can also feel myself struggling to do so when I converse with friends. I told a joke the other day, and without noticing, I relayed the events out of order. When I finally arrived at the punchline, nobody laughed. They hadn’t been able to follow the story, because I hadn’t created it. I had just given them a bunch of information, floating around like crumpled bits of torn-up paper, waiting to be put together.

I’m writing today because I sense that writing will help me reclaim my ability to create narrative, to tape those little bits of paper together into something meaningful. I have to tell a joke next week for one of my classes, and I have an ambitious goal: I want people to laugh so hard that they cry. I want to see tears. TEARS. But to do so, I think I’ll have to write “like I’m running out of time,” to borrow a phrase from a new role model of mine, A. Ham. And so here I am, writing.
