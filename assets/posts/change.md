Ha! I'm not going to write a list, sorry. Lists are for [THOSE WHO ARE BROKE](http://www.buzzfeed.com). And I am not broke. I *am* different than I was 8 weeks ago though. Re-reading my blog intro, I'm a little stunned by the weird things I said and the different beliefs I held. I guess that's growth for ya. Or regression. Only time will tell the difference. Or will the difference tell time? That's really going to bake your noodle later on.

All joking aside, Snape kills Batman. Oh, spoiler alert. Oops! Haha, "all joking aside." In ALL seriousness though, this past 8 weeks has been pretty interesting. I've been reading some books, playing some winter sports, and programming a lot. My favorite winter sports are racquetball and basketball. The award for "Coolest Book I've Read Since My Last Blog Post" goes to *The Poisonwood Bible*. It gave me a lot to think about, and showed me a new way of thinking about religion and Africa and life. I'd say it *changed* me. There. One. Seven more to go.

Until next time,

\- THE REAL JT
